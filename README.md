# icewm-windowsnt-theme
Windows NT theme for IceWM

Originally by HAZUKI on https://www.box-look.org/p/1018054/.  

This repo introduces small changes for consistency and accuracy.

You should set your TaskbarButtonWidthDivisor value in your IceWM preferences to a higher value, based on your screen resolution (`9` for 1920x1080) to get smaller taskbar buttons.
