# icewm-windowsnt-theme
Windows NT theme for IceWM

Originally by HAZUKI on https://www.box-look.org/p/1018054/.  

This repo introduces small changes for consistency and accuracy.

You should set your TaskbarButtonWidthDivisor value in your IceWM preferences to a higher value, based on your screen resolution (`9` for 1920x1080) to get smaller taskbar buttons.

Get WINE Tahoma font for the best experience (put these in your `.fonts` directory):
[tahoma.ttf](https://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob_plain/refs/tags/wine-5.0.1:/fonts/tahoma.ttf)
[tahomabd.ttf](https://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/blob_plain/refs/tags/wine-5.0.1:/fonts/tahomabd.ttf)  
Alternatively, get the font from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-tahoma)
